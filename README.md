# Universal Acceptance

This repository contains code samples showing how to use certain programming languages libraries correctly to support
internationalization, specifically email address
internationalization ([EAI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6530)) and internationalized domain
names ([IDNA2008](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5890)).

These code samples are the result of a comprehensive [reports on the libraries tested](./report/README.md).
