# Universal Acceptance

This repository contains code samples showing how to use certain programming languages libraries correctly to support
internationalization, specifically email address
internationalization ([EAI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6530)) and internationalized domain
names ([IDNA2008](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5890)).

# 2021 Test Run

2021 Test Run code samples are the result of a comprehensive report on the libraries tested [here](2021/README.md).
This report targeted the following development environments:

| Language | Platform |
|----------|----------|
| Swift    | iOS      |
| Kotlin   | Android  |
| PHP      | Windows  |
| PHP      | Linux    |

# 2022 Test Run

2022 exercise takes a subset of a previous [2020 report made by Viag√©nie](https://viagenie.ca/ua):

| Language   | Platform |
|------------|----------|
| Java       | Linux    |
| Python     | Linux    |
| Javascript | Linux    |

and focuses more on showcasing how to use these libraries & languages while ensuring compliance with EAI & IDN protocols.
The report, bug reports and complementary information are [here](2022/README.md).
